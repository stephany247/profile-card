          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I’m Stephanie, a frontend developer passionate about creating clean,
            responsive, and accessible web interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas
            into interactive experiences that feel intuitive and look
            well-balanced across all devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey started from curiosity — a simple fascination with how
            websites worked — and has grown into a love for building digital
            experiences that people can enjoy and easily navigate.

            <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>
              My main goal is to sharpen my frontend development skills —
              learning to write cleaner, scalable code while mastering modern
              practices in accessibility, layout design, and component
              structure. I also want to build more confidence in transforming
              design ideas into production-ready projects.
            </p>

          <section data-testid="test-about-confidence" class="card">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
              I sometimes struggle with debugging complex layout issues and
              ensuring full responsiveness across all screen sizes. I’m also
              working to improve my confidence in structuring JavaScript logic
              efficiently — especially when handling interactive components.

          <section data-testid="test-about-future-note" class="card">
            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>
              Keep going, no matter how slow the progress feels. Remember how
              far you’ve come from that first HTML tag. You’re not just learning
              to code — you’re learning persistence, clarity, and confidence.
              Keep building, keep growing, and never lose your curiosity.
            </p>

          <section data-testid="test-about-extra" class="card">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Every project, no matter how small, is a step toward mastery. The
              key is consistency — not perfection. Celebrate progress, stay
              curious, and always be kind to yourself during the process.
