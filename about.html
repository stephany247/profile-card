          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I&apos;m Stephanie, a frontend developer passionate about creating clean,
            responsive, and accessible web interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas
            into interactive experiences that feel intuitive and look
            well-balanced across all devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey started from curiosity, a simple fascination with how
            websites worked, and has grown into a love for building digital
            experiences that people can enjoy and easily navigate.

            <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>
              My goal is to grow as a frontend developer by learning to write
              cleaner, more scalable code and deepening my understanding of
              accessibility and design structure. I want to feel more confident
              turning creative ideas into real, functional projects that people
              can actually use and enjoy.

          <section data-testid="test-about-confidence" class="card">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
              I sometimes find debugging complex layout issues and ensuring full
              responsiveness across different screen sizes challenging. I&apos;m
              also working on improving my confidence in structuring JavaScript
              logic efficiently, especially when building interactive
              components.

            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>
              Keep going, no matter how slow the progress feels. Remember how
              far you&apos;ve come from that first HTML tag. You&apos;re not
              just learning to code, you&apos;re learning persistence, clarity,
              and confidence. Keep building, keep growing, and never lose your
              curiosity.

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Every little project is a step closer to mastery. What matters
              most is consistency, not perfection. Celebrate how far you’ve
              come, stay endlessly curious, and treat yourself with kindness
              along the way.
