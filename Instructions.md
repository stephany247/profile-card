:rocket: Frontend Wizards, Here’s Your Stage 1 Task! :rocket:
Welcome to Stage 1! :tada:
You’ll be moving from a single card into multi-page applications. In this stage, you’ll create two new pages — a Contact Us page with form validation, and an About Me page where you share your reflections. As always, semantic HTML, accessibility, responsiveness, and data-testid attributes are key.
NOTE: THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF YOUR PREVIOUS TASK, SO YOU WILL BE BUILDING ON YOUR STAGE 0 TASK.
